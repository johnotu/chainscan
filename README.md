# Chainscan

Chainscan provides an intuitive UI that anyone can use to explore data from a substrate network archived and run by Subsquid. It connects to any public Archive as well as a locally run Archive and fetches data using a GraphQL API.

It is a submission at the [Polkadot Hackathon: North America Edition](https://polkadot-na.devpost.com/) under Category 1: Interfaces & Experiences. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
